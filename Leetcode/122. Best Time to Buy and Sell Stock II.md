# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. 

**Example:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

跟之前那道[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/ZequnSong/Leetcode/blob/master/Leetcode/121.%20Best%20Time%20to%20Buy%20and%20Sell%20Stock.md) 很类似

* 可以无限次买入和卖出,低价买入高价抛出
* 只需要从第二天开始，如果当前价格比之前价格高，则把差值加入利润中
  * 因为我们可以昨天买入，今日卖出，若明日价更高的话，还可以今日买入，明日再抛出
```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length == 0) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)
            if(prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0) 
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        return res;
    }
}
```
