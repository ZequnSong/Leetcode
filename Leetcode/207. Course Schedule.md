# Course Schedule

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

拓扑排序

* BFS
* 构建有向图邻接矩阵graph
* 计算每个点的入度-->有多少点指向自己
* 将所有入度为0的点加入queue，这些均可以作为起始点，只要入队了，就可以选课，直接算入count中
* BFS依次将队列中取出的点的neighbors的入度-1，若入度为0，加入queue,加入count
