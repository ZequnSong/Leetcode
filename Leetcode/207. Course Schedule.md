# Course Schedule

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

拓扑排序

* BFS
* 构建有向图邻接矩阵graph
* 计算每个点的入度-->有多少点指向自己
* 将所有入度为0的点加入queue，这些均可以作为起始点，只要入队了，就可以选课，直接算入count中
* BFS依次将队列中取出的点的neighbors的入度-1，若入度为0，加入queue,加入count

```
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //build graph
        int[][] graph = new int[numCourses][numCourses];     
        
        //count in-degree
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];        
        for(int i= 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++){
            graph[prerequisites[i][1]][prerequisites[i][0]] = 1;
            indegree[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
        }
                
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < indegree.length; i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0){
                queue.add(i);
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int curCourse = queue.poll();
            for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
                if(graph[curCourse][i]!=0){
                    indegree[i]--;
                    if(indegree[i]==0){
                        queue.add(i);
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
