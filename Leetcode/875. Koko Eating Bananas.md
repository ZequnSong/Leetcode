# Koko Eating Bananas


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```
```
Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30

```


二分法

对于 piles = [3,6,7,11]
随着speed的增加，对应能吃完的时间会越来越少

```
 speed k    1  ...  3  4  5 ... 10  11
    hour   27  ... 10  8  8 ...  5   4 
```
我们要求最小的speed使其对应hour小于等于给定hour
所以要对speed进行二分，求每个speed下对应的时间，因为speed是我们要算的答案，所以此方法也叫对答案进行二分


```
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {

         int max = 0;
         for(int i : piles) {
             max = i > max ? i : max;
         }
         int left = 1, right = max;
         while(left < right) {
             int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
             if(eatTime(piles,mid)>h) left = mid+1;
             else right = mid;
         }
         return left;
    }

    private int eatTime(int[] piles, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i : piles) {
            sum += i / k + (i % k != 0 ? 1 : 0);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
