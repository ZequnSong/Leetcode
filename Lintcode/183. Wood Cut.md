# 183. Wood Cut

Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

**Example**
```
Input:
L = [232, 124, 456]
k = 7
Output: 114
Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
```
```
Input:
L = [1, 2, 3]
k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
```

Challenge
O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.

Notice
You couldn't cut wood into float length.

If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.

二分法
对切割长度二分
